							<p><strong>r</strong>Vision of a smarter planet. Understand where technology has gotten us. get real data in real time. change the way people live. The real challenge is things that society takes for granted. smarter planet is getting real data getting people to inter interact and understand some issues and be able to make smarter decisions to optimize the way we live but the things I want to reflect on is what are you going to do to make the world a smaller place what kind of skills do you need to be able to make the world a smaller place. students need to worry about what skills they need to have to succeed in the world going for how can they use the information that we're gathering from these range of sensors and new information sources how do we build new algorithms and techniques to analyze that get new intelligence new insight. write about how do I face challenges and how do I bring ideas to life. understantind what skills do I need and how would I grow them. interconected world. We are looking for passionate and original students who want to drive progress, grow their network and take their first steps toward a technology based career.more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. get involved in work that really changes the world?  culture of openness, collaboration and trust – where everyone has a voice?</p>

										<h3>Lorem gravida</h3>
										<p>(write text blog-style)I see on a daily basis lots of people wasting their time bc they have no course / purpose / goals / vision. Then I think life is so complex and yet so simple, you're just an automatic dispenser of entropy that has the ability to reduce it locally. Even those who think they're useless can be totally useful in some way. Imagine all those wasted days and days and days. Imagine how would the world be if everyone used their times relatively wisely. No need to be perfect, just having a smaller margin of error everyday starting by something small. You would say, changing the world is no easy task son, there millions of humans with a brain such as you or even smarter trying to sort that out. I'm not trying to make the world better (not that I dont want to). I'm trying to do that by having a clearer objective. Making it less worse / spreading the momentum of CHANGE (The notion of change being pragmatically possible). I wanna take responsability for the world I'll leave behind (at least a little part of the world even if its only a family). ¿¿Politics wont do it imo bc , using the analogy of the book "switch" its extremely hard to move people's elephant but it's easier to convince the rider by making a cleaner path. [till now I made tacitly clear the even economic statement that teamwork is stronger that individual work even with the brightest minds] We need different people, we need their ideas, then we need to organize those ideas and having people that turn ideas to reality {I was going in the direction of "we need people that think others that organize and others that.. in order to change the world... oh wait thats what a company do (IBM)  In short , that I'm one of those people that this company needs to keep changing the world"} . Solution. People like Elon Musk, people like me (if someone is reading this I'm not that arrogant lot, I'll make a point later), that are great at producing results by having a clear mindset (having things clear) like JPterson. Knowing why gives you a how and what you can and can't do. Being rational (that's part of IBM LIFE). It's incredible how nowadays you can build a career in tech from scratch totally for free, internet is fabulous. Even any career. ones are simpler than other to teach remotly but with quick-witted thinking we can figure out how to give tools to people (slogan : joining/ bringing  people closer to tools {to make changes}). The key is to make projects. In tech its true that you can make them online (easier) but in other careers [highliting slogan / my ability : creative / new ideas] you can too. E.g. In medicine you can learn theory and work as volutary nurse working your way up and acquiring more and more responsibilities and sharpening skills (this is just an ejemplo grosero ofc you need a matricula). The ideas is people like money and that is a great incentive to change their lives (how many people changed their lives and the world thanks the availability of learning to code online for free and having the chance of make a good living out of it???? its so awe-inspiring) End of the story that's what IBM is doing and I want to collaborate to bring new ideas / make it even better. Make a world smarter by doing things (improving every day lives technology {smart house, like smartphones did}) that will create millions of new jobs that require coding skills/ tech skills or skills in general but making them more available to learn online for free . Locally helping people get that kind of jobs will help a lot in changing their lives too , therefore/hence the world   Kinda like Elon Musk , not something complex and difficult to implement (that could also make great changes but the chances are lower), but, as an industrial engineer with mass production metality (I'm a fan of Henry Ford), doing simple and essential changes that can be reproduced at a great scale without a disapointing level of complexity/difficulty by the fact that the area of focus has been narrowed down. There's so much potential... if someone just cares, people , human beings that have been forgoten. create connections and allow people to have responabilities you'll can change A LOT. There's so much people (liek me) with so much desire to work. We  need the ritght poeple with the necessary skills to find a use for the rest</p>
